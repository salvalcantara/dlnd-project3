## Project 3 (Generate TV Scripts)

In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.


## Installation

pyenv virtualenv 3.6.2 tv-script-generation
pyenv activate tv-script-generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, open the solution notebook:
```
